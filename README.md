webadvisor-scraper
==================

Scrapes WebAdvisor for class times and locations to create a complete list of all classrooms and if they are free.

This was an issue raised during the [2013 CSA Election campaign](http://www.csaonline.ca), one of the candidates wants the university admin to create a list of empty classrooms to deal with the lack of study space on campus. This is not necessary, it can be created easily with no admin intervention.
