webadvisor-scraper
==================

Scrapes WebAdvisor for class times and locations to create a complete list of all classrooms and if they are free.
This was an issue raised during the 2013 CSA Election campaign, one of the candidates wants the university admin to create a list. This is not necessary, it can be created easily with no admin intervention.
